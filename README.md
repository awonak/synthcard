Synth Card for Adam Wonak

This synthcard is a circuit inspired by [Hagiwo's](https://www.youtube.com/@HAGIWO) SyncLFO and Bezier Curve, and the [Modulove](https://modulove.io/) Sync LFO. I chose this design because of the seemingly endless creative firmware scripts I have written for the [Modulove Sync LFO](https://awonak.github.io/HagiwoModulove/synclfo/), so I wanted to make a business card to highlight this circuit design with some fun tweaks.

This is an iteration of the SynthCard.com community from [Benjie Jiao](https://github.com/benjiao).
